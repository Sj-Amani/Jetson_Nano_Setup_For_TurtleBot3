# Jetson Nano Setup For TurtleBot3 
A tutorial for setting up the NVIDIA Jetson Nano for using in the TurtleBot3 Burger robot. However, I think for the Waffle and Waffle pi, it can also be used with slight modification.

## Introduction
**TurtleBot3** : TurtleBot3 is a small, affordable, programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research, hobby, and product prototyping. The TurtleBot3 Burger robot is the smallest and the one that I am using here.
