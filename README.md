# Jetson Nano Setup For TurtleBot3 
A tutorial for setting up the NVIDIA Jetson Nano for using in the TurtleBot3 Burger robot. However, I think for the Waffle and Waffle pi, it can also be used with slight modification.

## Introduction
**TurtleBot3** : TurtleBot3 is a small, affordable, programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research, hobby, and product prototyping. The TurtleBot3 Burger robot is the smallest and the one that I am using here.

**NVIDIA Jetson Nano** : NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit is a small, powerful computer that lets you run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing. All in an easy-to-use platform that runs in as little as 5 watts. Although the TurtleBot3 Burger comes with a Raspberry Pi 3 (mine is model B+), I don't want to use it and want to use a Jetson Nano instead. Jetson Nano can definitely give you more calculation power for your development while it's almost small as Raspberry Pi 3 and very affordable in term of electrcity consumption.
